# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

## My experience
In this challenge I used new units for margin and font size to have better adaptability. I haven't even touched on responsiveness yet due to lack of time, it's not my focus to improve that for now.
